# ResNet-caffe
Python script to generate resnet prototxt on Caffe

It's an implementation for the paper " Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition"

just finish generating the prototxt to be almost the same with the 
https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks

the experiments are still undergoing

the prototxt can be visualized by http://ethereon.github.io/netscope/#/editor, or use the draw_net.py provided by caffe
